# CD4017
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Lord-Nazdar/CD4017.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Lord-Nazdar/CD4017)

This is a dummy project aimed at testing various ways to put together a robust CI system for embedded development. The following pieces will be added in time:

* Linting
* Unit Testing
* Building

While primarily being a support case for my CI tests, this project is also replicating the behaviour of a CD4017B using an ATTiny2313A.
